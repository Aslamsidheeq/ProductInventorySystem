<h1>Product Inventory System</h1>
This is a simple inventory management system designed in short time to handle products, variants, and sub-variants , <strong>incomplete version.</strong> <hr/>
<strong>Done as two seperate solutions, without using a class library due to some environment issues.</strong><hr/>
The system allows you to create products, manage stock levels, and list available products.
While the current implementation is functional, there are several areas where improvements can be made to enhance the system's robustness, scalability, and maintainability.
<ul>
  <li>User registration and Login should be implemented.</li>
  <li>More enhanced error handling , case handling , logging , asynchronous programming , validations need to be added.</li>
  <li>Data perfomance improvements using stored procedures. </li>
  <li>Design for better user interface and experience.</li>
</ul>
